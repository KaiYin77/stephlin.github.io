We propose K-Closest Points (KCP), an efficient and effective laser scan
matching approach inspired by LOAM and TEASER++. The efficiency of KCP comes
from a feature point extraction approach utilizing the multi-scale curvature and
a heuristic matching method based on the k-closest points. The effectiveness of
KCP comes from the integration of the feature point matching approach and the
maximum clique pruning. We compare KCP against well-known scan matching
approaches on synthetic and real-world LiDAR data (nuScenes dataset). In the
synthetic data experiment, KCP-TEASER reaches a state-of-the-art
root-mean-square transformation error (0.006m, 0.014deg) with average
computational time 49ms. In the real-world data experiment, KCP-TEASER achieves
an average error of (0.018m, 0.101deg) with average computational time 77ms. This
shows its efficiency and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Through
theoretic derivation and empirical experiments, we also reveal the outlier
correspondence penetration issue of the maximum clique pruning that it may still
contain outlier correspondences.
